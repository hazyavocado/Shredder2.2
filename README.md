# Shredder2.2

based on Precious plastic shredder 2.1

Modified with smaller teeth to nibble away at big parts and hopefully not keep getting jammed.

The assembly file is a bit messy as I just hid the smaller parts and put the new parts in their place. The smaller blade spacers are still shown. 

The only parts you need for this are the 3 blades, new fixed blade, and new spacer.
