![4 flush](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71194240/221378129-b3c12dd1-3476-49ad-b792-860675397a71.JPG)

based on Precious plastic shredder 2.1

Modified with smaller teeth to nibble away at big parts and hopefully not keep getting jammed.

gap of 0.25mm between fixed and rotating blades

The only parts you need for this are the 3 blades, new fixed blades, and new spacer. 

spacer and fixed blade needed is the 51mm version

blade shape taken from shredder pro 13-blade design, the sldprt file allows you to change configurations to pick blades per cutting disk. I have them set to 3 blades which gives at minimum 2 cuts at a time. 

NOTE - do not install the blades as shown. they should be randomly arranged to keep un-shredded material from clumping against one side.
