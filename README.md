based on Precious plastic shredder 2.1

Modified with smaller teeth to nibble away at big parts and hopefully not keep getting jammed.

gap of 0.25mm between fixed and rotating blades

The only parts you need for this are the 3 blades, new fixed blades, and new spacer. 

spacer and fixed blade needed is the 51mm version
