# Shredder 2.2 - flush straight blade version
![4 flush](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71194240/221378129-b3c12dd1-3476-49ad-b792-860675397a71.JPG)

based on Precious plastic shredder 2.1

Modified with smaller teeth to nibble away at big parts and hopefully not keep getting jammed.

The assembly file is a bit messy as I just hid the smaller parts and put the new parts in their place. The smaller blade spacers are still shown. 

The only parts you need for this are the 3 blades, new fixed blades, and new spacer.
